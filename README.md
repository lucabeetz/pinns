# PINNS: Physics-Informed Neural Networks
This is a collection of notebooks for physics-informed neural networks.

The damped harmonic oscillator example is taken from [Ben Moseley's blog](https://benmoseley.blog/my-research/so-what-is-a-physics-informed-neural-network/)
and I reimplemented it using [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax) and [Haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku).
